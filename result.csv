0,Methods for targeting solid tumor stem cells in a solid tumor using a notch4 receptor antagonist,US7850961B2,"A small percentage of cells within an established solid tumor have the properties of stem cells. These solid tumor stem cells give rise both to more tumor stem cells and to the majority of cells in the tumor that have lost the capacity for extensive proliferation and the ability to give rise to new tumors. Thus, solid tumor heterogeneity reflects the presence of tumor cell progeny arising from a solid tumor stem cell. We have developed a xenograft model in which we have been able to establish tumors from primary tumors via injection of tumors in the mammary gland of severely immunodeficient mice. These xenograft assay have allowed us to do biological and molecular assays to characterize clonogenic solid tumor stem cells. We have also developed evidence that strongly implicates the Notch pathway, especially Notch 4, as playing a central pathway in carcinogenesis.",C12N5/0695 Stem cells; Progenitor cells; Precursor cellsView 17 more classifications,"Michael F, ClarkeSean J, MorrisonMax S, WichaMuhammad Al-Hajj",University of Michigan,"Methods for targeting solid tumor stem cells in a solid tumor using a notch4 receptor antagonistMichael F, ClarkeSean J, MorrisonMax S, WichaMuhammad Al-HajjUniversity of MichiganA small percentage of cells within an established solid tumor have the properties of stem cells.

1,Monoclonal antibodies for tumor treatment,US9309308B2,"A method of treating a tumor or enhancing survival of a subject having a tumor. The method includes (i) administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a humanized monoclonal antibody or a fragment thereof, wherein the antibody or the fragment thereof has all complementarity determining regions of murine monoclonal antibody BAT (mBAT-1) and a framework region (FR) from an acceptor human immunoglobulin, or modified therefrom; and (ii) administering to the subject an effective amount of at least one chemotherapeutic agent selected from the group consisting of: 5-fluorouracil, cytarabine, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel and combinations thereof. The humanized antibody is administered between 1 and 30 days after commencing chemotherapy or substantially simultaneously or concurrently or according to an overlapping schedule with the at least one chemotherapeutic agent to thereby treat the tumor or enhance the survival of the subject having the tumor.","C07K16/18 Immunoglobulins [IGs], e.g. monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against material from animals or humansView 8 more classifications",Rinat Rotem-YehudarGalina Rodionov,CureTech Ltd,"Monoclonal antibodies for tumor treatmentRinat Rotem-YehudarGalina RodionovCureTech LtdA method of treating a tumor or enhancing survival of a subject having a tumor.
